# database-assignment-1

This is my assignment in Database, its score is equal to mid-term test

The problem surroundings things:

- 1a. Make a relation diagram ( primary key, null key, foreign key ) from the provided excel files.

- 1b. Write the script for the database ( In SQL ).

- 2. Write code ( u can write in c++, python or java; but i chose python because it is easier ) to create SQL files containing the commands to insert information from Excel sheets into corresponding tables in a database. Then, if you run the output file, it will fill the tables for you.

p/s: i will write more, i think so
